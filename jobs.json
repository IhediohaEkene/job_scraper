    "body": "As you know, a lot of remote jobs are restricted geographically to a country, state, or even city.\n\nThere are jobs out there that are genuinely work from anywhere, or almost anywhere—so-called \"worldwide/global\" remote jobs.\n\nBut they're competitive and less common.\n\nAnd if you've ever tried to find them via LinkedIn, you know just how frustrating it is with LinkedIn's search. Don't even get me started on Indeed lol .\n\nThe following job boards focus on or have dedicated pages/search functions for true work-from-anywhere positions, and are regularly updated.\n\n1. [**Real Work from Anywhere**](https://www.realworkfromanywhere.com/) \\- Can't not mention this site (that's the point of the site).\n2. [**Remote100K**](https://remote100k.com/) \\- $100k+ remote roles only. Has a dedicated page for 'anywhere' jobs paying $100k+: [https://remote100k.com/remote-jobs/anywhere](https://remote100k.com/remote-jobs/anywhere)\n3. [**We Work Remotely**](https://weworkremotely.com/) \\- Large board with strong \"anywhere\" filter, also has a dedicated page: [https://weworkremotely.com/100-percent-remote-jobs](https://weworkremotely.com/100-percent-remote-jobs)\n4. [**Working Nomads**](https://www.workingnomads.com/) \\- Built for location-independent digital nomads, has a dedicated page here: [https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs?location=anywhere](https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs?location=anywhere)\n5. [**RemoteOK**](https://remoteok.com/) \\- Clear \"worldwide\" tags for global positions: [https://remoteok.com/?location=Worldwide](https://remoteok.com/?location=Worldwide)\n6. [**NoDesk**](https://nodesk.co/remote-jobs/) \\- Digital nomad-focused job board. You can filter by \"worldwide\" jobs on the search filter.\n\nNot going to lie, these kinds of jobs are competitive, but just stay persistent, and don't restrict yourself to job boards. They're great, but also connect with people on LinkedIn, optimize your profile and pitch directly to companies looking to hire.\n\nIn my experience, some (but not many) jobs advertised as \"remote (location)\" are actually open to a more worldwide remote job, so don't discount that.\n\nHope this helps!",

I have hands-on experience building production-level systems and would love to contribute to teams working on applied AI or hardware-software integrated projects.\n\nI previously worked as a Developer Intern at Garvish Marketing Pvt. Ltd., where I built and deployed a real-time GPS + GSM–based vehicle tracking system using ESP32 microcontrollers. I improved system reliability by reducing packet loss by 40% through MQTT buffering and helped scale the deployment from 5 to 20+ devices. The system is currently used in commercial operations.\n\nSome of my notable projects include SeismoSense, an early earthquake detection platform using ESP32 sensor nodes and deep learning for P-wave detection. The system achieved sub-2-second alert latency and placed Top 4 at Hack-a-Holic. I also developed a Bus Management System with computer vision and GPS integration, reaching 95% accuracy in passenger detection and integrating it into my university’s ERP.\n\nMy technical skills include TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, FastAPI, ESP32/Arduino, Python, C++, C, Java, JavaScript, and Git. I also hold certifications from Stanford (Supervised ML), AWS, and Google Cloud. I have been a finalist in two national hackathons and currently serve as a Research Advisor for the IEEE Club, mentoring students in AI/ML projects.\n\nI’m open to remote or on-site internships in India.

We've been doing this for almost 20 years.\n\nWe're OGS Media, the agency Fortune 100 brands call when they need to actually succeed on Reddit, not just check a box. TikTok, American Express, Purple, Asurion, and even smaller brands like Devicie and Core Balance Training. We've turned Reddit skeptics into Reddit believers and helped brands become part of communities rather than interruptions.\n\n**Here's the reality:**\n\nReddit marketing is hard to hire for because it barely exists as a profession yet. You can't just know Reddit and learn marketing. You can't just know marketing and learn Reddit. You need both, deeply, or you'll get clients banned from communities they need to be in.\n\nWe need someone who understands the nuance between being a helpful human and being a brand account. Someone who sees the subtle opportunities to represent a client without breaking rules or pissing off communities. Someone who thinks independently about outcomes, not tactics on a checklist.\n\nThis role isn't about gaming karma or scaling promotional posts. It's about making brands more Reddit-like. Helping them join conversations they should be part of. Finding creative solutions that make moderators smile instead of reaching for the ban button.\n\n**What you'll actually do:**\n\n* Manage enterprise clients who want authentic Reddit presence (we're talking real brands, not startups with $500 budgets)\n* Create content strategies that communities upvote because they're genuinely useful\n* Build relationships with subreddit mods the right way, respecting their communities\n* Work with brands to develop authentic content that communities actually want to engage with\n* Turn data into insights that guide strategy\n* Work directly with our founder and lead strategist\n\n**You need to have:**\n\n* 2-3 years managing clients in digital marketing (Reddit marketing experience is ideal, but genuine Reddit understanding is what matters)\n* Exceptional writing ability and voice-matching skills\n* Independence, you don't need hand-holding\n* An analytical mind that turns observations into action\n* Active Reddit experience, you've posted, commented, engaged. If you've never participated in Reddit communities, this isn't for you.\n\n**What makes this different:**\n\nYou're pioneering Reddit marketing expertise while most agencies are still figuring out if Reddit even matters. We work directly with Reddit, publish Reddit thought leadership on major platforms, join Reddit-hosted AMAs, and present on Reddit all over the world. We've turned crisis situations into case studies. You'll be learning from someone who has worked with the founders and maintains working relationships throughout Reddit.\n\nWe're not a corporate bullshit factory. We don't do micromanagement. We pay in stable USD regardless of where you are. You get 15 days paid leave and actual work-life balance.\n\n**The specifics:**\n\n* $3,000-$4,000 USD monthly (B2B contract)\n* 100% remote, work from anywhere\n* Hours: 7:00am-3:00pm ET Monday-Friday\n* Start ASAP\n* Tools: Canva, Reddit PRO, G-Suite\n\n**Interview process:**\n\n* Send your CV (or link to it) and tell me why you think Reddit marketing is different from every other channel\n* Complete a strategic client scenario (we respect your time, this tests thinking not busywork)\n* Three focused conversations, no corporate theater\n\n**Who shouldn't apply:**\n\nSpammers. People who think Reddit is just another social channel. Anyone who wants to \"hack\" or \"growth hack\" their way through communities. People who see rules as obstacles rather than respect signals. If you think karma farming is a strategy, this isn't for you.\n\n**Who should absolutely apply:**\n\nClient-facing professionals who want to become experts in something most marketers don't understand. People who get that Reddit's culture demands authenticity, not polish. Independent thinkers who care about outcomes and understand that helping communities is how you build brand value.\n\nDM me your CV and tell me why you think Reddit marketing is different from every other channel. Not a cover letter, just your actual thoughts.\n\nWe're building something here. Reddit's importance is exploding, search results are flooded with Reddit content, AI models are trained on Reddit conversations. The brands that figure this out now will dominate their categories in search for years. You can be part of making that happen for companies that matter.\n\nThis is career-building territory, not a gig.",

    "body": "Let go in March, April and May I tried to get set up with a small business side-hustle so I could have additional money coming in and possibly turn it into a full time job, didn't work out as a full on alternative.  \n  \nApplied to tons of jobs through that time and into later months, I was feeling anxious every day. I was getting shot down for roles that paid half of what I had made at my previous position (that I was still willing to take and would have been great at), it was all extremely frustrating and feeling hopeless.  \n  \nUnemployment insurance period ran out. Some weeks I couldn't emotionally bring myself to trawl listings and focused on the side-hussle, which was making enough to make me feel like I had something going on and did a great job of making me feel productive and less of a loser). \n\nFinally got a bite around the end of October for a job I didn't even remember applying to, I checked my records and verified my application sent early September. Accepted a job offer last week after a few rounds of interviews. I'll still be making less than I was before, but there was already talk of putting me in a better position next year. Everything totally remote.  \n  \nYou never know what job will be the one to contact you, just keep at it. Apply through official company websites (I got contacted by a ton of scams), and keep a log and confirmation emails for any position you apply to - I had a lot of scam contact attempts just totally making up a role or job they claimed I had applied to.  \n  \nI am feeling very lucky because I expected to find nothing in November/December or even Jan or until April when most white collar company departments get their new budgets.  \n  \nI know it can feel like screaming, begging, and pleading into the void, and things can feel hopeless, but chances are you'll land something sooner or later, but it's not going to happen unless you keep at it.

    "body": "My company has always been known for having extravagant Christmas parties this time of year and they’re planning the upcoming one at a hotel there’s going to be a pool, jacuzzi, drinks on tap etc etc.  \n  \nHonestly I get it, it’s good for company culture it’s good to review the year and see people in the company you haven’t seen in a long time. But the way they’re going about it is nothing short of BIZARRE  \n  \nSo all of a sudden they’re saying that whoever helps plan the party gets a surprise Christmas present from the company (we literally have a HR lady planning the entire thing anyway). And you have to come in to the office to plan the event for some reason.. I know makes no sense.  \n  \nOn top of this, the General manager is saying that ‘I don’t want the first time I’m seeing people for the year to be at Christmas’. ‘Please make your way down to the office a few times before then so I can see faces’  \n  \nBut the weirdest thing is every single meeting we talk about how after Christmas everyone is going to be ‘so friendly’ with each other that we’ll need a bigger office because everyone will want to come in more often and they keep actively asking people individually if they’d like a desk a few days a week going in to 2026.  \n  \nIt just seems like they’re beating around the bush. I may not even go to the Christmas party and I would respect them so much more if they just straight up said ‘we have some extra desks, it is mandatory that you at least do a few days a week in the office a month’  \n  \nI’m secretly hoping the Christmas thing becomes a big flop and no one talks about it again because it’s just getting awkward. From speaking to people in the company no one even wants to go to the party as it’s far for most people, not everyone even celebrated Christmas and everyone I’ve spoken to has had the general manager personally reach out to them (he barely speaks to any of us usually it’s just not his role) to pitch having a desk moving forward.",

My goal is to build a stable remote income, improve my lifestyle, and eventually settle somewhere that fits me better.\n\nRight now I feel a bit stuck.

It was like they had been reborn as productivity champions. Except… every now and then someone would forget to mute, and we’d hear a microwave ding. Or a grocery store scanner. Or, in one legendary moment last week, very clear airport boarding announcements. My favorite was yesterday when someone confidently said “let me share my screen” followed by a full minute of silence and then “uh… give me a second” while everyone politely pretended not to hear TikTok in the background.

    "title": "stressful ambiguity around hybrid work",
    "body": "Last month, as my mat leave was ending, I contacted my supervisor to ask about switching to a four day week, with two days in office and two days out of office. My job is entirely desk work, about 70% independent work on my computer, 20% meetings with external clients online, and 10% in person meetings with fellow staff (where there is always a hybrid/online option, for the staff who are working remote). Prior to going on mat leave, I had only been on the job four months, however, in that time, I had very good reviews, past my probation, and was leading meetings with our biggest clients (and supporting the training and onboarding). In my review, my manager said she had \"no concerns.\"\n\nDuring my short time at work, prior to going on leave, it became very evident that the position could be entirely remote (and, that the push from remote work from staff was becoming a source of tension). Overall, there is a hybrid model at play, across the entire organization; however, it is not formalized and there is a vast descrpendacy between teams (and, even people on teams) around the expectations of in person and remote work.\n\nWhen I made the request, my supervisor came back and said it was not possible to change to a four day week. I said that I completely understood, and then proceeded to request that I have an arrangement of two days in office, and three remote. It was my understanding, when I was at the office, that many people on my team were working three days in office (including myself, operating on a 3/4 days in office, 1/2 remote). I have an eight month old at home (whom my partner, on leave, is currently caring for), my job is easily done entirely remotely, and I have only had positive feedback. My supervisor didn't respond for a month, and finally, after extensive follow-up from me, seeking something in writing, she responded (about a week prior to me starting work) that it was not possible to fulfill my request. She explained that for our team, everyone is required to be in office for a minium of three days-stating it was necessary for team collaboration. I said that I understood.\n\nNow I am back at work, and it is evident that while some team members come in four days, others come in only one day (with no repercussions). Aside from observing this discrepancy, I'm reminded of how it is nearly impossible to get work done in the office, due to the amount of talking. I went to lengths to develop a hybrid plan, and communiate my desire to formalize it, out of respect for my supervisor and wanting to adhere to due process. It seems, however, that people on my team just do what they want (I have yet to have a day where the whole team is there-so the reasoning my supervisor cited for being in office...for in person collaboration...feels illegitimate).\n\nI'm starting to feel like I have little control over my time, and the only reason for me being in office is for a sense of optics. I'm not saying that because I have a baby I deserve special treatment, but realizing that I am being held to standards others are not (mainly because I've gone out of my way to have a respectful conversation with my supervisor, formalizing the specificty of my hybrid arrangement). This is starting to feel like a tough pill to swallow.\n\nI'm feeling incentivized to self-advocate, and initiate a conversation with my supervisor, letting her know that I am observing the discrepancies in hybrid arrangements and reiterate that I feel I am certainly deserving as the same treatment as others. But, before I do that, I'd love to gain any insight from anyone who has thoughts on a) what the situation maybe is (am I overlooking something?) and b) what the best way to go about negotiating this is? Thanks so much!",

I'm still pretty early in my journey, so would love to hear what more experienced people are doing too.\n\n* **My methods:**\n\n**Getting Things Done by David Allen**  \nYour brain is for creating ideas, not storing them. Anytime something pops up - task, idea, whatever - I dump it into a system I trust. Then I will go back and deal with it at a certain time: do it, delegate it, or save it for later.\n\n**Document &gt; Talk**\n\nI used to default to calls, but now I try to write everything down, notes, decisions, tradeoffs. Just having stuff written makes async easier and helps me think more clearly\n\n**Say “I don’t know” faster**  \nI had the unrealistic expectation to know everything as a PM, but trying to fake confidence was exhausting. It’s way more helpful to say “I’m not sure yet, let me dig in.” Builds trust and speeds up learning.\n\n**Deep Work by Cal Newport:** I keep strict work hours and a separate space, telling my brain it's \"work mode.\" Also, I put on my work clothes. It sounds simple, works for me\n\n* **Tools I use:**\n\n**ChatGPT**  \nThis thing is a beast. Way faster than Googling. When I need to research some topics, it’s saved me a ton of time. What used to take days know just take hours lol. I tried many tools and now comeback to this\n\n**Miro**  \nBest for brainstorming with my team. I like the endless white space, and different sticky notes color. The UI is easy to use\n\n**Read**  \nAn ai meeting note taker. I use it simply to record/document every things we discussed\n\n**Saner**  \nA work assistant app. I dump todos, notes, calendar and just ask when I need smt. It even schedules, reminds me automatically\n\n**Noise cancelling headphone**  \nEasily one of the most helpful purchase. There's a construction near my house so this is a must lol\n\nAnd that’s my list. Curious to hear about methods/tools that made your WFH life easier",

    "body": "Hi everyone. I'm a 29 years old, full stack dev with 5+ years of experience (been developing longer than 7 years). Got multiple systems published and being used by clients at the moment.\n\nBefore diving deeper into the post, my rate is $25/hr.\n\nSkills:  \n\\- Frontend: React/React Native/Flutter/Vue/Tailwind/Shadcn and global state manager libs like Redux/Jotai/Zustand  \n\\- Backend: Node (Nest/Next) and Laravel are the environments I'm most comfortable with. But I have developed projects with Go (Echo) and Python as well.  \n\\- Database: More comfortable with SQL. Also have experience with NoSQL. I know how to normalize and structure a db as well.  \n\\- Cloud: AWS, GCP.  \n\\- DevOps: Docker\n\nNow, since there are tons of technologies and stacks, I don't want to bloat every single framework I know here. Because what I see is that people are looking for devs with for example Prisma but I don't honestly think that it makes sense to type it here as a skill. Typing ORM as a skill also is not necessary because if you're developing backend, ofc you have to use ORM. If you have very minor specifications like these, simply ask and I'll either tell and show something that uses it from my github repos, or I'll say that I don't know it.\n\nLooking for something (preferably) long-term. For the last 4-5 years, I had been taking care of my dad, resulting in not-consistent work hours. He has passed away few months ago. And now I'm married and in need of something stable.\n\nFrom Git-Flow to testing, local-dev-stage-prod environments with docker, logging, deployment, I try building everything within the given timeframe. Also have experience with CI/CD.\n\nCheers,  \nFatih",

    "body": "My company has always been known for having extravagant Christmas parties this time of year and they’re planning the upcoming one at a hotel there’s going to be a pool, jacuzzi, drinks on tap etc etc.  \n  \nHonestly I get it, it’s good for company culture it’s good to review the year and see people in the company you haven’t seen in a long time. But the way they’re going about it is nothing short of BIZARRE  \n  \nSo all of a sudden they’re saying that whoever helps plan the party gets a surprise Christmas present from the company (we literally have a HR lady planning the entire thing anyway). And you have to come in to the office to plan the event for some reason.. I know makes no sense.  \n  \nOn top of this, the General manager is saying that ‘I don’t want the first time I’m seeing people for the year to be at Christmas’. ‘Please make your way down to the office a few times before then so I can see faces’  \n  \nBut the weirdest thing is every single meeting we talk about how after Christmas everyone is going to be ‘so friendly’ with each other that we’ll need a bigger office because everyone will want to come in more often and they keep actively asking people individually if they’d like a desk a few days a week going in to 2026.  \n  \nIt just seems like they’re beating around the bush. I may not even go to the Christmas party and I would respect them so much more if they just straight up said ‘we have some extra desks, it is mandatory that you at least do a few days a week in the office a month’  \n  \nI’m secretly hoping the Christmas thing becomes a big flop and no one talks about it again because it’s just getting awkward. From speaking to people in the company no one even wants to go to the party as it’s far for most people, not everyone even celebrated Christmas and everyone I’ve spoken to has had the general manager personally reach out to them (he barely speaks to any of us usually it’s just not his role) to pitch having a desk moving forward.",

It was like they had been reborn as productivity champions. Except… every now and then someone would forget to mute, and we’d hear a microwave ding. Or a grocery store scanner.

My favorite was yesterday when someone confidently said “let me share my screen” followed by a full minute of silence and then “uh… give me a second” while everyone politely pretended not to hear TikTok in the background.

    "title": "stressful ambiguity around hybrid work",
    "body": "Last month, as my mat leave was ending, I contacted my supervisor to ask about switching to a four day week, with two days in office and two days out of office. My job is entirely desk work, about 70% independent work on my computer, 20% meetings with external clients online, and 10% in person meetings with fellow staff (where there is always a hybrid/online option, for the staff who are working remote). Prior to going on mat leave, I had only been on the job four months, however, in that time, I had very good reviews, past my probation, and was leading meetings with our biggest clients (and supporting the training and onboarding). In my review, my manager said she had \"no concerns.\"\n\nDuring my short time at work, prior to going on leave, it became very evident that the position could be entirely remote (and, that the push from remote work from staff was becoming a source of tension). Overall, there is a hybrid model at play, across the entire organization; however, it is not formalized and there is a vast descrpendacy between teams (and, even people on teams) around the expectations of in person and remote work.\n\nWhen I made the request, my supervisor came back and said it was not possible to change to a four day week. I said that I completely understood, and then proceeded to request that I have an arrangement of two days in office, and three remote. It was my understanding, when I was at the office, that many people on my team were working three days in office (including myself, operating on a 3/4 days in office, 1/2 remote). I have an eight month old at home (whom my partner, on leave, is currently caring for), my job is easily done entirely remotely, and I have only had positive feedback. My supervisor didn't respond for a month, and finally, after extensive follow-up from me, seeking something in writing, she responded (about a week prior to me starting work) that it was not possible to fulfill my request. She explained that for our team, everyone is required to be in office for a minium of three days-stating it was necessary for team collaboration. I said that I understood.\n\nNow I am back at work, and it is evident that while some team members come in four days, others come in only one day (with no repercussions). Aside from observing this discrepancy, I'm reminded of how it is nearly impossible to get work done in the office, due to the amount of talking. I went to lengths to develop a hybrid plan, and communiate my desire to formalize it, out of respect for my supervisor and wanting to adhere to due process. It seems, however, that people on my team just do what they want (I have yet to have a day where the whole team is there-so the reasoning my supervisor cited for being in office...for in person collaboration...feels illegitimate).\n\nI'm starting to feel like I have little control over my time, and the only reason for me being in office is for a sense of optics. I'm not saying that because I have a baby I deserve special treatment, but realizing that I am being held to standards others are not (mainly because I've gone out of my way to have a respectful conversation with my supervisor, formalizing the specificty of my hybrid arrangement). This is starting to feel like a tough pill to swallow.\n\nI'm feeling incentivized to self-advocate, and initiate a conversation with my supervisor, letting her know that I am observing the discrepancies in hybrid arrangements and reiterate that I feel I am certainly deserving as the same treatment as others. But, before I do that, I'd love to gain any insight from anyone who has thoughts on a) what the situation maybe is (am I overlooking something?) and b) what the best way to go about negotiating this is? Thanks so much!",

I'm still pretty early in my journey, so would love to hear what more experienced people are doing too.\n\n* **My methods:**\n\n**Getting Things Done by David Allen**  \nYour brain is for creating ideas, not storing them. Anytime something pops up - task, idea, whatever - I dump it into a system I trust. Then I will go back and deal with it at a certain time: do it, delegate it, or save it for later.\n\n**Document &gt; Talk**\n\nI used to default to calls, but now I try to write everything down, notes, decisions, tradeoffs. Just having stuff written makes async easier and helps me think more clearly\n\n**Say “I don’t know” faster**  \nI had the unrealistic expectation to know everything as a PM, but trying to fake confidence was exhausting. It’s way more helpful to say “I’m not sure yet, let me dig in.” Builds trust and speeds up learning.\n\n**Deep Work by Cal Newport:** I keep strict work hours and a separate space, telling my brain it's \"work mode.\" Also, I put on my work clothes. It sounds simple, works for me\n\n* **Tools I use:**\n\n**ChatGPT**  \nThis thing is a beast. Way faster than Googling. When I need to research some topics, it’s saved me a ton of time. What used to take days know just take hours lol. I tried many tools and now comeback to this\n\n**Miro**  \nBest for brainstorming with my team. I like the endless white space, and different sticky notes color. The UI is easy to use\n\n**Read**  \nAn ai meeting note taker. I use it simply to record/document every things we discussed\n\n**Saner**  \nA work assistant app. I dump todos, notes, calendar and just ask when I need smt. It even schedules, reminds me automatically\n\n**Noise cancelling headphone**  \nEasily one of the most helpful purchase. There's a construction near my house so this is a must lol\n\nAnd that’s my list. Curious to hear about methods/tools that made your WFH life easier",

You don’t need a security background to understand the output.\n\n---\n\n### Tech I focus on \n- Typical web stacks: Next.js/React, Javascript/Typescript, Python/Java backends, etc.\n- No-code / low-code: Bubble, Webflow, and similar tools (privacy rules, workflows, API configs)\n- Most databases - cloud services or self-hosted.\n\nIf you’re not sure your stack fits, you can DM me and I’ll tell you quickly whether I can help.\n\n---\n\n### Pricing &amp; turnaround\n\nFor a typical MVP-sized app:\n\n&gt; **Flat fee: $250 USD**  \n&gt; 24-hour turnaround from the moment I have access to what I need\n\nIf your project is larger (multiple services/repos, more complex infra), I’m happy to look at it and quote a custom price.\n\n---\n\n### About me\n\n- Experienced software engineer with experience in backend, infra, and security-adjacent work  \n- Currently focused on helping small teams and indie founders ship safer apps without enterprise-audit pricing  \n\nYou can see more details about how I work on my site:  \nhttps://securelyvibe.com/  \n\n---\n\n### How to get started\n\nIf you’re interested, please **DM me** with:\n\n1. A one-liner about what your app does  \n2. Tech stack (e.g. “Bubble app with Stripe + user logins”, “Ecommerce store with next.js + NodeJS backend API”)  \n3. Whether it’s live or pre-launch  \n4. Any specific worries (secrets, auth, user data, etc.)\n\nI’ll reply with a couple of quick questions, confirm scope, and share a proposed timeline (usually next-day) before we start.\n\nThanks for reading, and happy to answer questions in the comments.\n",

    "body": "As you know, a lot of remote jobs are restricted geographically to a country, state, or even city.\n\nThere are jobs out there that are genuinely work from anywhere, or almost anywhere—so-called \"worldwide/global\" remote jobs.\n\nBut they're competitive and less common.\n\nAnd if you've ever tried to find them via LinkedIn, you know just how frustrating it is with LinkedIn's search. Don't even get me started on Indeed lol .\n\nThe following job boards focus on or have dedicated pages/search functions for true work-from-anywhere positions, and are regularly updated.\n\n1. [**Real Work from Anywhere**](https://www.realworkfromanywhere.com/) \\- Can't not mention this site (that's the point of the site).\n2. [**Remote100K**](https://remote100k.com/) \\- $100k+ remote roles only. Has a dedicated page for 'anywhere' jobs paying $100k+: [https://remote100k.com/remote-jobs/anywhere](https://remote100k.com/remote-jobs/anywhere)\n3. [**We Work Remotely**](https://weworkremotely.com/) \\- Large board with strong \"anywhere\" filter, also has a dedicated page: [https://weworkremotely.com/100-percent-remote-jobs](https://weworkremotely.com/100-percent-remote-jobs)\n4. [**Working Nomads**](https://www.workingnomads.com/) \\- Built for location-independent digital nomads, has a dedicated page here: [https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs?location=anywhere](https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs?location=anywhere)\n5. [**RemoteOK**](https://remoteok.com/) \\- Clear \"worldwide\" tags for global positions: [https://remoteok.com/?location=Worldwide](https://remoteok.com/?location=Worldwide)\n6. [**NoDesk**](https://nodesk.co/remote-jobs/) \\- Digital nomad-focused job board. You can filter by \"worldwide\" jobs on the search filter.\n\nNot going to lie, these kinds of jobs are competitive, but just stay persistent, and don't restrict yourself to job boards. They're great, but also connect with people on LinkedIn, optimize your profile and pitch directly to companies looking to hire.\n\nIn my experience, some (but not many) jobs advertised as \"remote (location)\" are actually open to a more worldwide remote job, so don't discount that.\n\nHope this helps!",

I have hands-on experience building production-level systems and would love to contribute to teams working on applied AI or hardware-software integrated projects.\n\nI previously worked as a Developer Intern at Garvish Marketing Pvt. Ltd., where I built and deployed a real-time GPS + GSM–based vehicle tracking system using ESP32 microcontrollers. I improved system reliability by reducing packet loss by 40% through MQTT buffering and helped scale the deployment from 5 to 20+ devices. The system is currently used in commercial operations.\n\nSome of my notable projects include SeismoSense, an early earthquake detection platform using ESP32 sensor nodes and deep learning for P-wave detection. The system achieved sub-2-second alert latency and placed Top 4 at Hack-a-Holic. I also developed a Bus Management System with computer vision and GPS integration, reaching 95% accuracy in passenger detection and integrating it into my university’s ERP.\n\nMy technical skills include TensorFlow, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, FastAPI, ESP32/Arduino, Python, C++, C, Java, JavaScript, and Git.

    "title": "[Hiring] Reddit Marketer Who Gets It - $3K-4K/mo USD - Remote",
    "body": "Most agencies are scrambling to figure out Reddit right now. We've been doing this for almost 20 years.\n\nWe're OGS Media, the agency Fortune 100 brands call when they need to actually succeed on Reddit, not just check a box. TikTok, American Express, Purple, Asurion, and even smaller brands like Devicie and Core Balance Training. We've turned Reddit skeptics into Reddit believers and helped brands become part of communities rather than interruptions.\n\n**Here's the reality:**\n\nReddit marketing is hard to hire for because it barely exists as a profession yet. You can't just know Reddit and learn marketing. You can't just know marketing and learn Reddit. You need both, deeply, or you'll get clients banned from communities they need to be in.\n\nWe need someone who understands the nuance between being a helpful human and being a brand account. Someone who sees the subtle opportunities to represent a client without breaking rules or pissing off communities. Someone who thinks independently about outcomes, not tactics on a checklist.\n\nThis role isn't about gaming karma or scaling promotional posts. It's about making brands more Reddit-like. Helping them join conversations they should be part of. Finding creative solutions that make moderators smile instead of reaching for the ban button.\n\n**What you'll actually do:**\n\n* Manage enterprise clients who want authentic Reddit presence (we're talking real brands, not startups with $500 budgets)\n* Create content strategies that communities upvote because they're genuinely useful\n* Build relationships with subreddit mods the right way, respecting their communities\n* Work with brands to develop authentic content that communities actually want to engage with\n* Turn data into insights that guide strategy\n* Work directly with our founder and lead strategist\n\n**You need to have:**\n\n* 2-3 years managing clients in digital marketing (Reddit marketing experience is ideal, but genuine Reddit understanding is what matters)\n* Exceptional writing ability and voice-matching skills\n* Independence, you don't need hand-holding\n* An analytical mind that turns observations into action\n* Active Reddit experience, you've posted, commented, engaged. If you've never participated in Reddit communities, this isn't for you.\n\n**What makes this different:**\n\nYou're pioneering Reddit marketing expertise while most agencies are still figuring out if Reddit even matters. We work directly with Reddit, publish Reddit thought leadership on major platforms, join Reddit-hosted AMAs, and present on Reddit all over the world. We've turned crisis situations into case studies. You'll be learning from someone who has worked with the founders and maintains working relationships throughout Reddit.\n\nWe're not a corporate bullshit factory. We don't do micromanagement. We pay in stable USD regardless of where you are. You get 15 days paid leave and actual work-life balance.\n\n**The specifics:**\n\n* $3,000-$4,000 USD monthly (B2B contract)\n* 100% remote, work from anywhere\n* Hours: 7:00am-3:00pm ET Monday-Friday\n* Start ASAP\n* Tools: Canva, Reddit PRO, G-Suite\n\n**Interview process:**\n\n* Send your CV (or link to it) and tell me why you think Reddit marketing is different from every other channel\n* Complete a strategic client scenario (we respect your time, this tests thinking not busywork)\n* Three focused conversations, no corporate theater\n\n**Who shouldn't apply:**\n\nSpammers. People who think Reddit is just another social channel. Anyone who wants to \"hack\" or \"growth hack\" their way through communities. People who see rules as obstacles rather than respect signals. If you think karma farming is a strategy, this isn't for you.\n\n**Who should absolutely apply:**\n\nClient-facing professionals who want to become experts in something most marketers don't understand. People who get that Reddit's culture demands authenticity, not polish. Independent thinkers who care about outcomes and understand that helping communities is how you build brand value.\n\nDM me your CV and tell me why you think Reddit marketing is different from every other channel. Not a cover letter, just your actual thoughts.\n\nWe're building something here. Reddit's importance is exploding, search results are flooded with Reddit content, AI models are trained on Reddit conversations. The brands that figure this out now will dominate their categories in search for years. You can be part of making that happen for companies that matter.\n\nThis is career-building territory, not a gig.",

Apply through official company websites (I got contacted by a ton of scams), and keep a log and confirmation emails for any position you apply to - I had a lot of scam contact attempts just totally making up a role or job they claimed I had applied to.  \n  \nI am feeling very lucky because I expected to find nothing in November/December or even Jan or until April when most white collar company departments get their new budgets.  \n  \nI know it can feel like screaming, begging, and pleading into the void, and things can feel hopeless, but chances are you'll land something sooner or later, but it's not going to happen unless you keep at it. You got this.",

    "body": "My company has always been known for having extravagant Christmas parties this time of year and they’re planning the upcoming one at a hotel there’s going to be a pool, jacuzzi, drinks on tap etc etc.  \n  \nHonestly I get it, it’s good for company culture it’s good to review the year and see people in the company you haven’t seen in a long time. But the way they’re going about it is nothing short of BIZARRE  \n  \nSo all of a sudden they’re saying that whoever helps plan the party gets a surprise Christmas present from the company (we literally have a HR lady planning the entire thing anyway). And you have to come in to the office to plan the event for some reason.. I know makes no sense.  \n  \nOn top of this, the General manager is saying that ‘I don’t want the first time I’m seeing people for the year to be at Christmas’. ‘Please make your way down to the office a few times before then so I can see faces’  \n  \nBut the weirdest thing is every single meeting we talk about how after Christmas everyone is going to be ‘so friendly’ with each other that we’ll need a bigger office because everyone will want to come in more often and they keep actively asking people individually if they’d like a desk a few days a week going in to 2026.  \n  \nIt just seems like they’re beating around the bush. I may not even go to the Christmas party and I would respect them so much more if they just straight up said ‘we have some extra desks, it is mandatory that you at least do a few days a week in the office a month’  \n  \nI’m secretly hoping the Christmas thing becomes a big flop and no one talks about it again because it’s just getting awkward. From speaking to people in the company no one even wants to go to the party as it’s far for most people, not everyone even celebrated Christmas and everyone I’ve spoken to has had the general manager personally reach out to them (he barely speaks to any of us usually it’s just not his role) to pitch having a desk moving forward.",

    "title": "stressful ambiguity around hybrid work",
    "body": "Last month, as my mat leave was ending, I contacted my supervisor to ask about switching to a four day week, with two days in office and two days out of office. My job is entirely desk work, about 70% independent work on my computer, 20% meetings with external clients online, and 10% in person meetings with fellow staff (where there is always a hybrid/online option, for the staff who are working remote). Prior to going on mat leave, I had only been on the job four months, however, in that time, I had very good reviews, past my probation, and was leading meetings with our biggest clients (and supporting the training and onboarding). In my review, my manager said she had \"no concerns.\"\n\nDuring my short time at work, prior to going on leave, it became very evident that the position could be entirely remote (and, that the push from remote work from staff was becoming a source of tension). Overall, there is a hybrid model at play, across the entire organization; however, it is not formalized and there is a vast descrpendacy between teams (and, even people on teams) around the expectations of in person and remote work.\n\nWhen I made the request, my supervisor came back and said it was not possible to change to a four day week. I said that I completely understood, and then proceeded to request that I have an arrangement of two days in office, and three remote. It was my understanding, when I was at the office, that many people on my team were working three days in office (including myself, operating on a 3/4 days in office, 1/2 remote). I have an eight month old at home (whom my partner, on leave, is currently caring for), my job is easily done entirely remotely, and I have only had positive feedback. My supervisor didn't respond for a month, and finally, after extensive follow-up from me, seeking something in writing, she responded (about a week prior to me starting work) that it was not possible to fulfill my request. She explained that for our team, everyone is required to be in office for a minium of three days-stating it was necessary for team collaboration. I said that I understood.\n\nNow I am back at work, and it is evident that while some team members come in four days, others come in only one day (with no repercussions). Aside from observing this discrepancy, I'm reminded of how it is nearly impossible to get work done in the office, due to the amount of talking. I went to lengths to develop a hybrid plan, and communiate my desire to formalize it, out of respect for my supervisor and wanting to adhere to due process. It seems, however, that people on my team just do what they want (I have yet to have a day where the whole team is there-so the reasoning my supervisor cited for being in office...for in person collaboration...feels illegitimate).\n\nI'm starting to feel like I have little control over my time, and the only reason for me being in office is for a sense of optics. I'm not saying that because I have a baby I deserve special treatment, but realizing that I am being held to standards others are not (mainly because I've gone out of my way to have a respectful conversation with my supervisor, formalizing the specificty of my hybrid arrangement). This is starting to feel like a tough pill to swallow.\n\nI'm feeling incentivized to self-advocate, and initiate a conversation with my supervisor, letting her know that I am observing the discrepancies in hybrid arrangements and reiterate that I feel I am certainly deserving as the same treatment as others. But, before I do that, I'd love to gain any insight from anyone who has thoughts on a) what the situation maybe is (am I overlooking something?) and b) what the best way to go about negotiating this is? Thanks so much!",

    "body": "My company has struggled to retain CSRs locally or remotely so we are looking internationally - specifically the Philippines. Boss posted online at onlinejobs.ph and received overwhelming response. He’s narrowed his search down to two candidates for two positions.  One of the candidates is behaving exactly how research says to pick candidate. The second candidate is throwing red flags everywhere that boss is choosing to ignore.\n\nRed flag 🚩 1: she did not apply through onlinejobs.ph. She found our company online and sent her resume in directly to our email.\n\nRed flag 🚩 2: she interviewed via zoom without headphones. Our research has started CSRs from Philippines all have the proper equipment to complete the job.\n\nRed flag 🚩 3: she quit her current job before an offer was made.\n\nRed flag 🚩 4: she’s asked for payment in advance for equipment she needs to do the job properly.\n\nRed flag 🚩 5: she’s asking for paid holidays outside of our company’s standard policy.  Specifically she wants to get paid time off for US holidays and Phillipeans Holidays plus personal holidays (ie her anniversary with her partner).\n\nRed flag 🚩 6: we can’t get in touch with any of her references. We reached out to the companies she has on her resume and one stated they have no record of her employment. Other companies haven’t returned our numerous calls.\n\nMy boss is far into the sunken cost fallacy and is all yolo with this.  I am putting in as many measures as I can in place to make sure she has limited to no access to any financial information but would love any advice you guys have. \n\nPlease feel free to sit back and watch with me as this situation explodes around me.",

    "body": "Hey folks, just wanted to share a few things that have really helped me become more efficient. I'm still pretty early in my journey, so would love to hear what more experienced people are doing too.\n\n* **My methods:**\n\n**Getting Things Done by David Allen**  \nYour brain is for creating ideas, not storing them. Anytime something pops up - task, idea, whatever - I dump it into a system I trust. Then I will go back and deal with it at a certain time: do it, delegate it, or save it for later.\n\n**Document &gt; Talk**\n\nI used to default to calls, but now I try to write everything down, notes, decisions, tradeoffs. Just having stuff written makes async easier and helps me think more clearly\n\n**Say “I don’t know” faster**  \nI had the unrealistic expectation to know everything as a PM, but trying to fake confidence was exhausting. It’s way more helpful to say “I’m not sure yet, let me dig in.” Builds trust and speeds up learning.\n\n**Deep Work by Cal Newport:** I keep strict work hours and a separate space, telling my brain it's \"work mode.\" Also, I put on my work clothes. It sounds simple, works for me\n\n* **Tools I use:**\n\n**ChatGPT**  \nThis thing is a beast. Way faster than Googling. When I need to research some topics, it’s saved me a ton of time. What used to take days know just take hours lol. I tried many tools and now comeback to this\n\n**Miro**  \nBest for brainstorming with my team. I like the endless white space, and different sticky notes color. The UI is easy to use\n\n**Read**  \nAn ai meeting note taker. I use it simply to record/document every things we discussed\n\n**Saner**  \nA work assistant app. I dump todos, notes, calendar and just ask when I need smt. It even schedules, reminds me automatically\n\n**Noise cancelling headphone**  \nEasily one of the most helpful purchase. There's a construction near my house so this is a must lol\n\nAnd that’s my list. Curious to hear about methods/tools that made your WFH life easier",

I was hired remote 3 years ago, and earlier this year, I was forced into an office (where there is zero productivity/networking/social/collaboration benefit). I am now in a situation where I am almost positive that I have a ticket away from current company. You don’t even know how excited I am about this…perhaps you do. \n\nI have this fantasy of stating stuff in my resignation letter how it was the CEO’s RTO policy that pissed me off so much (something to that effect). \n\nHas anybody done this, and do you think it made any impact? It probably would hurt me more in than hurt or change the current company’s policy. Just looking for opinions on this. Or maybe I just want to read other success stories like this 🙂.\n Thanks all!",

    "body": "My company has always been known for having extravagant Christmas parties this time of year and they’re planning the upcoming one at a hotel there’s going to be a pool, jacuzzi, drinks on tap etc etc.  \n  \nHonestly I get it, it’s good for company culture it’s good to review the year and see people in the company you haven’t seen in a long time. But the way they’re going about it is nothing short of BIZARRE  \n  \nSo all of a sudden they’re saying that whoever helps plan the party gets a surprise Christmas present from the company (we literally have a HR lady planning the entire thing anyway). And you have to come in to the office to plan the event for some reason.. I know makes no sense.  \n  \nOn top of this, the General manager is saying that ‘I don’t want the first time I’m seeing people for the year to be at Christmas’. ‘Please make your way down to the office a few times before then so I can see faces’  \n  \nBut the weirdest thing is every single meeting we talk about how after Christmas everyone is going to be ‘so friendly’ with each other that we’ll need a bigger office because everyone will want to come in more often and they keep actively asking people individually if they’d like a desk a few days a week going in to 2026.  \n  \nIt just seems like they’re beating around the bush. I may not even go to the Christmas party and I would respect them so much more if they just straight up said ‘we have some extra desks, it is mandatory that you at least do a few days a week in the office a month’  \n  \nI’m secretly hoping the Christmas thing becomes a big flop and no one talks about it again because it’s just getting awkward. From speaking to people in the company no one even wants to go to the party as it’s far for most people, not everyone even celebrated Christmas and everyone I’ve spoken to has had the general manager personally reach out to them (he barely speaks to any of us usually it’s just not his role) to pitch having a desk moving forward.",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m hoping to get some guidance from people who’ve already made the transition to remote work.\n\nI’m 23, have about 1.5 years of experience in tech(full stack development), and I’m trying to shift my career toward fully remote work so I can eventually relocate or travel long-term. My goal is to build a stable remote income, improve my lifestyle, and eventually settle somewhere that fits me better.\n\nRight now I feel a bit stuck. I’m not sure how to break into remote positions, what skills I should be focusing on, or which platforms/strategies actually work in 2025. I keep hearing mixed opinions about remote job markets being competitive, so I’m trying to figure out what actually works from people who have done it.\n\nWhat I’m looking for advice on:\n\t•\tWhich skills or tech stacks are most in demand for fully remote roles\n\t•\tWhere to find legit remote jobs (sites, communities, recruiters)\n\t•\tHow to stand out when applying (portfolio? projects? certifications?)\n\t•\tGeneral tips on transitioning from office work to 100% remote\n\nIf you’ve been through this transition or work remotely now, I’d really appreciate any insight, mistakes to avoid, or steps I should follow.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share advice or point me in the right direction!\n",

The same people who always typed “sorry catching up on something” in chat suddenly became extremely active. Instant replies. Fully formed answers. Detailed updates. It was like they had been reborn as productivity champions. Except… every now and then someone would forget to mute, and we’d hear a microwave ding. Or a grocery store scanner. Or, in one legendary moment last week, very clear airport boarding announcements. My favorite was yesterday when someone confidently said “let me share my screen” followed by a full minute of silence and then “uh… give me a second” while everyone politely pretended not to hear TikTok in the background. I’m not judging. Honestly I’m impressed. Remote work continues to show me that half the magic is just timing your keyboard noises convincingly.",

    "title": "stressful ambiguity around hybrid work",
    "body": "Last month, as my mat leave was ending, I contacted my supervisor to ask about switching to a four day week, with two days in office and two days out of office. My job is entirely desk work, about 70% independent work on my computer, 20% meetings with external clients online, and 10% in person meetings with fellow staff (where there is always a hybrid/online option, for the staff who are working remote). Prior to going on mat leave, I had only been on the job four months, however, in that time, I had very good reviews, past my probation, and was leading meetings with our biggest clients (and supporting the training and onboarding). In my review, my manager said she had \"no concerns.\"\n\nDuring my short time at work, prior to going on leave, it became very evident that the position could be entirely remote (and, that the push from remote work from staff was becoming a source of tension). Overall, there is a hybrid model at play, across the entire organization; however, it is not formalized and there is a vast descrpendacy between teams (and, even people on teams) around the expectations of in person and remote work.\n\nWhen I made the request, my supervisor came back and said it was not possible to change to a four day week. I said that I completely understood, and then proceeded to request that I have an arrangement of two days in office, and three remote. It was my understanding, when I was at the office, that many people on my team were working three days in office (including myself, operating on a 3/4 days in office, 1/2 remote). I have an eight month old at home (whom my partner, on leave, is currently caring for), my job is easily done entirely remotely, and I have only had positive feedback. My supervisor didn't respond for a month, and finally, after extensive follow-up from me, seeking something in writing, she responded (about a week prior to me starting work) that it was not possible to fulfill my request. She explained that for our team, everyone is required to be in office for a minium of three days-stating it was necessary for team collaboration. I said that I understood.\n\nNow I am back at work, and it is evident that while some team members come in four days, others come in only one day (with no repercussions). Aside from observing this discrepancy, I'm reminded of how it is nearly impossible to get work done in the office, due to the amount of talking. I went to lengths to develop a hybrid plan, and communiate my desire to formalize it, out of respect for my supervisor and wanting to adhere to due process. It seems, however, that people on my team just do what they want (I have yet to have a day where the whole team is there-so the reasoning my supervisor cited for being in office...for in person collaboration...feels illegitimate).\n\nI'm starting to feel like I have little control over my time, and the only reason for me being in office is for a sense of optics. I'm not saying that because I have a baby I deserve special treatment, but realizing that I am being held to standards others are not (mainly because I've gone out of my way to have a respectful conversation with my supervisor, formalizing the specificty of my hybrid arrangement). This is starting to feel like a tough pill to swallow.\n\nI'm feeling incentivized to self-advocate, and initiate a conversation with my supervisor, letting her know that I am observing the discrepancies in hybrid arrangements and reiterate that I feel I am certainly deserving as the same treatment as others. But, before I do that, I'd love to gain any insight from anyone who has thoughts on a) what the situation maybe is (am I overlooking something?) and b) what the best way to go about negotiating this is? Thanks so much!",

Our research has started CSRs from Philippines all have the proper equipment to complete the job.\n\nRed flag 🚩 3: she quit her current job before an offer was made.\n\nRed flag 🚩 4: she’s asked for payment in advance for equipment she needs to do the job properly.\n\nRed flag 🚩 5: she’s asking for paid holidays outside of our company’s standard policy.  Specifically she wants to get paid time off for US holidays and Phillipeans Holidays plus personal holidays (ie her anniversary with her partner).\n\nRed flag 🚩 6: we can’t get in touch with any of her references. We reached out to the companies she has on her resume and one stated they have no record of her employment. Other companies haven’t returned our numerous calls.\n\nMy boss is far into the sunken cost fallacy and is all yolo with this.

    "body": "Hey folks, just wanted to share a few things that have really helped me become more efficient. I'm still pretty early in my journey, so would love to hear what more experienced people are doing too.\n\n* **My methods:**\n\n**Getting Things Done by David Allen**  \nYour brain is for creating ideas, not storing them. Anytime something pops up - task, idea, whatever - I dump it into a system I trust. Then I will go back and deal with it at a certain time: do it, delegate it, or save it for later.\n\n**Document &gt; Talk**\n\nI used to default to calls, but now I try to write everything down, notes, decisions, tradeoffs. Just having stuff written makes async easier and helps me think more clearly\n\n**Say “I don’t know” faster**  \nI had the unrealistic expectation to know everything as a PM, but trying to fake confidence was exhausting. It’s way more helpful to say “I’m not sure yet, let me dig in.” Builds trust and speeds up learning.\n\n**Deep Work by Cal Newport:** I keep strict work hours and a separate space, telling my brain it's \"work mode.\" Also, I put on my work clothes. It sounds simple, works for me\n\n* **Tools I use:**\n\n**ChatGPT**  \nThis thing is a beast. Way faster than Googling. When I need to research some topics, it’s saved me a ton of time. What used to take days know just take hours lol. I tried many tools and now comeback to this\n\n**Miro**  \nBest for brainstorming with my team. I like the endless white space, and different sticky notes color. The UI is easy to use\n\n**Read**  \nAn ai meeting note taker. I use it simply to record/document every things we discussed\n\n**Saner**  \nA work assistant app. I dump todos, notes, calendar and just ask when I need smt. It even schedules, reminds me automatically\n\n**Noise cancelling headphone**  \nEasily one of the most helpful purchase. There's a construction near my house so this is a must lol\n\nAnd that’s my list. Curious to hear about methods/tools that made your WFH life easier",
